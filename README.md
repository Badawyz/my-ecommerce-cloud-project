## Setup Instructions
# Step 1: Navigate to the project root directory
cd path/to/your/project

# Step 2: Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm i

# Step 3: Return to the root directory
cd ..

# Step 4: Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm i

# Step 5: Install Nginx dependencies
cd nginx
npm i 

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Kubernetes

### Running the Project
1. **Docker**: `docker-compose up --build`
2. **Kubernetes**: Apply the configurations in the `kubernetes/` directory.

## Usage
1-Open Your Web Browser: Launch your preferred web browser.
2-Navigate to the Frontend UR(http://localhost:3000)
3-Explore the E-Commerce Website: You should see the homepage of your e-commerce website. From here, you can:
   . Browse Products: View the list of products available for purchase.
   . View Product Details: Click on a product to see more details.
   . Add Products to Cart: Select products and add them to your shopping cart.
   . Checkout: Proceed to checkout to place an order.

4-Using the Backend  
 The backend provides the API endpoints that the frontend interacts with. You can also use tools like Postman to directly interact with these endpoints for testing purposes.

API Endpoints:

Products:
GET /api/products: Retrieve a list of all products.
GET /api/products/:id: Retrieve details of a specific product by ID.
POST /api/products: Add a new product (requires authentication).
PUT /api/products/:id: Update an existing product by ID (requires authentication).
DELETE /api/products/:id: Delete a product by ID (requires authentication).
Users:
POST /api/users/login: User login.
POST /api/users/register: User registration.
GET /api/users/profile: Retrieve logged-in user's profile (requires authentication).
Orders:
POST /api/orders: Create a new order (requires authentication).
GET /api/orders/:id: Retrieve details of a specific order by ID (requires authentication).
Interacting with the API:

Using Postman: You can use Postman to send HTTP requests to your API endpoints. For example, to get the list of products, you would:
Open Postman.
Create a new GET request.
Enter the URL http://localhost:5000/api/products.
Click "Send".



5-Docker:

Start Services with Docker Compose:
(docker-compose up )


6-Kubernetes:

Apply Kubernetes Configurations:
(kubectl apply -f kubernetes/)

Additional Notes
Environment Variables: Ensure that all required environment variables are properly configured in your .env files for both the frontend and backend.
Database: Make sure your database is running and accessible by your backend service.
Authentication: For routes that require authentication, ensure that you have implemented a login mechanism and are including the necessary authentication tokens in your requests.
By following these steps, you will be able to successfully use and interact with your e-commerce project.
